Game(int n, int m)

	vector[][] gameBoard
	boolean playerOneTurn
	int m
	int n
	
	
	void generateBoard(int n) 
	void printBoard() - 2 for loops to append the board characters to a string buffer		
	boolean gameOver() - searches for a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line
	void addToBoard(int) - int of the column that was decided by the player		
	

Human_Player(boolean isTurn)

	boolean isTurn
	int takeTurn(vector[][]) - returns an int of the selected column - set !isTurn 	
	

AI_Player

	boolean isTurn
	int takeTurn(vector[][]) - returns an int of the selected column - set !isTurn
		- will call other methods such as alpha-beta pruning methods
